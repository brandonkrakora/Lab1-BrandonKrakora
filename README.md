Part 2
Pass 17 through the function, hard code it in main. 

Part 3
I would have tested it by print statements since it does not
return anything. 

Part 4
From part 2 and part 3, part 2 is a void function, meaning it
has no return type. In part 3, we are returning the data in a 
string array. We did that because we can test the data with
the java test class. Part 3 is being stored in a Arrary while
part is being stored in a list. You would use a Array 
when you know exactly how many inputs of n. you would use an
List when you do not know how many n's there are.
